Decribe Platform as a service
	- Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a 		service). 
	- In a PaaS environment, the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. 
	- They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. 
	- In a PaaS scenario, you don't have to worry about the licensing or patching for operating systems and databases.
	- PaaS is well suited to provide a complete development environment without the headache of maintaining all the development infrastructure.
	
	
Shared Responsibility Model
	- PaaS splits the responsibility between you and the cloud provider.
	- The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the internet, just like in IaaS.\
	- In the PaaS model, the cloud provider will also maintain the operating systems, databases, and development tools. 
	- Depending on the configuration, you or the cloud provider may be responsible for networking settings and connectivity within your cloud environment,network and application security, 		and the directory infrastructure.
