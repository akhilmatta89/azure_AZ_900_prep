Describe IaaS

	- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is the most flexible category of cloud services, as it provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources. 
	- In an IaaS model, the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security. 
	- You’re responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration; and so on. 
	- With IaaS, you’re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you.

Shared responsibility model
	- The shared responsibility model applies to all the cloud service types. 
	- IaaS places the largest share of responsibility with you. 
	- The cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure and its access to the internet. 
	- You’re responsible for installation and configuration, patching and updates, and security.
