Describe Software as a Service :- 
	- Software as a service (SaaS) is the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. 
	- With SaaS, you’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application. 
	- Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software are all common examples of a SaaS implementation.

Shared responsibility model:
	- SaaS is the model that places the most responsibility with the cloud provider and the least responsibility with the user. 
	- In a SaaS environment you’re responsible for the data that you put into the system, the devices that you allow to connect to the system, and the users that have access. 
	- The cloud provider is responsible for physical security of the datacenters, power, network connectivity, and application development and patching.
