	Here two types of expenses are to be considered
		- capital expenditure(CapEx)
		- operational expenditure(OpEx)
		
	capital expenditure(CapEx):
		- This is a one time investement or upfront expenditure to purchace the tangible resources
		- A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.
		
	Operational expenditure(OpEx):
		- OpEx is spending money on services or products over time
		- Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.
		
		
	Cloud computing falls under OpEx because you dont pay anything upfront, whatever resource you use you pay for it
	If you are not using anyresource this moth you wont get any bill
