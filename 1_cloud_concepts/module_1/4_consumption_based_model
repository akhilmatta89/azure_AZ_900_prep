What is consumption based model?
	Here two types of expenses are to be considered
		- capital expenditure(CapEx)
		- operational expenditure(OpEx)
		
	capital expenditure(CapEx):
		- This is a one time investement or upfront expenditure to purchace the tangible resources
		- A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.
		
	Operational expenditure(OpEx):
		- OpEx is spending money on services or products over time
		- Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.
		
		
	- Cloud computing falls under OpEx because you dont pay anything upfront, whatever resource you use you pay for it
	- If you are not using anyresource this month you wont get any bill
	- In cloud computing you dont pay for any physical server/power/security or anything else associated with mainatining a datacentre
	
	This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:
		- No upfront costs.
		- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
		- The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
		- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
