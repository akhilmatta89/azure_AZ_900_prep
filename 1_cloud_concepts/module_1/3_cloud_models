	Private:- 
		- This is nothing but the cloud maintained by the single entity(company itself)
		- The data centre is present in the company itself
		- It should be maintained completely by the organization
		- potentially it can even be maintained by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.

	Public:- 
		- This is build, controlled and maintained by the third party service provider
		- Anyone who want to get the cloud resources can purchase and use it 
		- The general public availability is the only difference between/w private and public
	Hybrid:-
		- This the cloud computing environment where it uses both private and public cloud resources in a inter-connected environment
		- Hybrid cloud provides the extra layer of security
		- Users can flexibly choose which service to keep in cloud and which to keep in private cloud infrastructures

	Multi Cloud:-
		- Here it is the combination of multiple public cloud providers and managing resources and security in both environments.
		- Maybe you will use different features from different cloud providers.

	Azure Arc:-
		- This is the set of technologies that helps to manage your cloud environment 
		- It manages your cloud environment, whether it's a public clod solely on azure/private cloud in data centre/a hybrid configuration or a multi cloud environment running on multi cloud providers.

	

	Azure VMware solution:-
		- if you have already a vm which is installed via private cloud and you wan to move It to a public/hybrid  environment then azure VMware solution lets you run your VM workloads in azure with seamless 	
			integration and scalability.
