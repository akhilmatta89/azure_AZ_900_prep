Describe the shared responsibility model?
	- firstly lets talk about traditional corporate data centre
		- here the company is responsible of maiantaing physical space, power, 24 hours support, security , maitaing/replacing of servers
		- IT team is responsible of maianting it or keeping it updated to keep the data centre up and running
		- They are also responsibrl for all teh patches and maianting the correct versions
		
	- Now coming to shared responsbility model based on the service you take from the cloud providers the responsbilities changes for the cloud provider and the consumer
		- Normally physical security, power, cooling and network connectivity are maintained by the cloud provider
		
		
		
		IaaS :- Infrastructure as a service
			- IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It includes servers, storage, networking, and virtualization.
			
			consumer manages:
				- OS (Operating System)
				- Middleware
				- Runtime
				- Applications
				- Data
				
			Cloud provider Manages:
				- Virtual machines
				- Storage
				- Networking
				- Physical servers and infrastructure
				
			The use case was if you want full control over teh environment with out maintaing hardware this is best
			
			Examples:
				- Amazon EC2
				- Google Compute Engine
				- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
				- DigitalOcean Droplets
				
		PaaS :- Platform as a service
			- PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure and runtime 				environment.
		
			consumer manages:
				- Applications
				- Data

			Cloud provider Manages:
				- OS
				- Middleware
				- Runtime
				- Servers
				- Storage
				- Networking

			Use case: Focus on coding/development, not infrastructure setup.
			
			Examples
				- Google App engine
				- Heroku
				- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
				- Microsoft Azure App Services
				
		SAAS :- Software as a service
			 - SaaS delivers fully functional software applications over the internet. Users simply access the software through a browser or app.
			 
			 consumer manages:
			 	- Just use the application
			 	- Minimal to no configuration

			 Cloud provider Manages:
			 	- Everything: infrastructure, platform, application
			 
			 Use case: End-user application consumption.
			  
			 Examples:
			 	- Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Sheets)
			 	- Microsoft 365
			 	- Salesforce
			 	- Dropbox
			 	- Zoom

When using a cloud provider, youâ€™ll always be responsible for:
	- The information and data stored in the cloud
	- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
	- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization
	
The cloud provider is always responsible for:
	- The physical datacenter
	- The physical network
	- The physical hosts
				
				
Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:
	- Operating systems
	- Network controls
	- Applications
	- Identity and infrastructure
